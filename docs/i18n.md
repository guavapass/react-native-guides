## Internationalization (I18n)

We use PhraseApp to manage the translations. The following are the steps to work with PhraseApp.

### Add New Translations

Whenever there is a new translations, after updating the locale locally, we need to push to PhraseApp by `phraseapp push`. After that, notify the translators with the new locale keys that they need to translate. Once they are done, go to PhraseApp and click on the **GitHub Sync** button, which will create a PR for the new translations.

### Update Existing Translations

**DO NOT** update the translation locally.
Instead, update the translation on PhraseApp, notify the translators for the translation updates, then use the **GitHub Sync** to create a PR for the updated translations.
